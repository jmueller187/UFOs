# UFOs
Building tables and webpages using JavaScript, Bootstrap and CSS.

[Deployed UFO's Web Application](https://jmueller187.github.io/UFOs/)

## Overview of Project:
After creating a UFO Sightings webpage containing a dynamic table of data which could be searched by entering a sighting date, we were tasked with providing an opportunity to perform a more granular analysis by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Along with the original date field, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape associated with each sighting.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
When users visit the webpage, they now have five options in the Filter Search section to search for specific entries in the UFO sighting data. They can narrow their search by choosing a search field, entering the appropriate criteria and pressing Enter to initiate the search. The filtering options are as follows:

1) Filter by Date

2) Filter by City

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
